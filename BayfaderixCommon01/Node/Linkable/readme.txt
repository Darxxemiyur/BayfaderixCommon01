Originally was intended to be used to build "pipes" to pipe various object in an application.
Custom modifications could have allowed routable passing of payloads from one place to another.
It did not, however, see the day-light. Maybe in the future. But for now it is incomplete, and potentially obsolete.


P.S. However it would have been indeed cool to have an object that serves as a feeding pipe to pass around
in an application, potentially granting easy ways of implementing various restrictions, consequences and ETC
without modifying some "pipe worker"(pipe in -> work -> pipe out) node/system.
