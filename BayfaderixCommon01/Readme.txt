Yes, I know there is readme.md
Yes, I don't use it here(for now) on purpose.

This is my library of stuff that I found can be generalized and used anywhere, so I moved it here from specialized and private code.
Feel free to use it if you want to, but be careful, you may(or may not) encounter bugs or anti-patterns, though not necessarily so.

It is ugly, I don't remember a lot of what I was thinking of when I was making parts of it, but it is my ugly lil lib.
